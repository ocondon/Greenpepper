<h1>Sample bank test</h1>

<h2>Testing a sequence of actions on a System</h2>

Let's walk through a simple example of a test using a flow style interpreter.

<div>
    <p> First, we need to import the package containing the fixture code for our banking application. </p>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
            <td>import</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>com.greenpepper.samples.fixture.bank</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<div>
<p>
We want to execute a sequence of actions on the bank fixture. We'll use the <code>DoWithInterpreter</code> for that.
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
        <td>do with</td>
        <td>bank</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Our first business rule says that a new account should have a balance of 0.00 dollars. <br/>
    We will verify this rule with two actions. The first one opens and account and the second one checks its
    balance. The <code>check</code> keyword - in the first cell of the second row - indicates that we want to check
    the result of the action against the value specified in the last cell.
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
        <td>open checking account</td>
        <td>12345</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>check</td>
        <td>that balance of account</td>
        <td>12345</td>
        <td>is</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Savings account should follow the same rule. Let's verify that.
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
        <td>open savings account</td>
        <td>54321</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>check</td>
        <td>that balance of account</td>
        <td>54321</td>
        <td>is</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Our next rule says that the bank should not take any fee when we deposit money in our account.
    <br/>
    So if we deposit 100 dollars in one of the newly created accounts, we expect the balance to be exactly 100 dollars:
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
        <td>deposit money</td>
        <td>100</td>
        <td>in</td>
        <td>12345</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>check</td>
        <td>that balance of account</td>
        <td>12345</td>
        <td>is</td>
        <td>100</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    The following rule says that a customer should be able to withdraw funds if the balance of his account is
    sufficient.
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
        <td>withdraw money</td>
        <td>50</td>
        <td>from</td>
        <td>12345</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>check</td>
        <td>that balance of account</td>
        <td>12345</td>
        <td>is</td>
        <td>50</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Nevertheless, checking accounts cannot go overdrawn. If we attempt to withdraw too much money, the bank should
    reject our request.
    <br/>
    Let's try that:
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
        <td>reject</td>
        <td>withdraw money</td>
        <td>75</td>
        <td>from</td>
        <td>12345</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>check</td>
        <td>that balance of account</td>
        <td>12345</td>
        <td>is</td>
        <td>50</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Once an account is frozen, we can deposit money in it, but not longer withdraw any money
    from it.
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
        <td>freeze account</td>
        <td>12345</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>deposit money</td>
        <td>75</td>
        <td>in</td>
        <td>12345</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>withdraw money</td>
        <td>25</td>
        <td>from</td>
        <td>12345</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>check</td>
        <td>that balance of account</td>
        <td>12345</td>
        <td>is</td>
        <td>125</td>
    </tr>
</table>

</div>

<h2>Testing collections of values returned by the System</h2>

In this section, we demonstrate the use of another interpreter, the <code>SetOfInterperter</code>.

We want to check that all the accounts created previously have been correctly registered by the bank.


<div>
    <p>
        Let's create a new account to make the test a bit more interesting.
    </p>

    <table border="1" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
            <td>open checking account</td>
            <td>67890</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>check</td>
            <td>that balance of account</td>
            <td>67890</td>
            <td>is</td>
            <td>0</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        Let's list the accounts known to the bank and check their numbers.
    </p>

    <table border="1" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
            <td>set of</td>
            <td>existing accounts</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>number</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>12345</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>67890</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>54321</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        Our final test uses the <code>SubSetOfInterpreter</code> to verify a (you've gessed it) subset of accounts
        against the list of accounts opened at the bank.

        Notice that if one of the specified accounts doesn't exist, it is noted missing in the result table.
    </p>

    <table border="1" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
            <td>subset of</td>
            <td>existing accounts</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>number</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>67890</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>87890</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
